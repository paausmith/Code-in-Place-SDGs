# Code-in-Place-SDGs
Date of the project: 2020 <br>
<br>
This is a small final project of the course Code in Place that I took on Python programming.<br>
<br>
The programme's aim is to learn about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a game. It does not cover all 17 SDGs, but the code can be expanded to include them all. The programme includes brief descriptions of the SDGs, how to contribute to them on a personal level and a small game where you have to guess the name of the SGDs. <br>
<br>
The code is written in Python. It has comments divided by steps, but it has been a while since I last looked at the code, maybe it needs some updates that I will do at some point. <br> 
<br>
The repository includes some screenshots as a preview.
